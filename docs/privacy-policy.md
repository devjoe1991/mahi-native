# Mahi Privacy Policy (Draft)

_Last updated: November 22, 2025_

Mahi is committed to protecting your data and complying with Apple
App Store and Google Play policies. Host this document at `https://mahi.fit/privacy-policy` and keep it in sync with the app.

## Data We Collect
- **Account data**: first/last name, email, optional phone number, date of birth, fitness goal
- **Contacts**: only when you explicitly allow access to find friends; synced contacts stay on-device unless you invite someone
- **Calendar events**: event titles/time ranges for workout detection; information stays local
- **Photos**: images you capture or upload for your profile and streaks

We do **not** collect health metrics from Apple Health or Google Fit yet. Those features will only ship once the privacy manifests and policies are updated again.

## How We Use Data
- Provide personalized fitness challenges and reminders
- Enable social features like friend discovery and streak celebrations
- Communicate product updates and account notifications (email/SMS)

## Sharing & Retention
- Data is stored in encrypted databases (Supabase) and object storage
- We do not sell personal data or use it for third-party advertising
- Content is retained until you delete your account or remove an item manually

## Your Choices
- Permissions (Contacts, Calendar, Camera) can be changed anytime in device settings
- You can request data export or deletion by emailing `privacy@mahi.fit`
- Opt out of marketing emails from the unsubscribe link in each message
